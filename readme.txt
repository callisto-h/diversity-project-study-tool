This study study tool should help in memorizing the phylum/classes/orders/families outlined in our diversity notebook project -- many of these may not be included, so I may have gone slightly overboard.

This script requires python3, and sources all of the study content from an associated "answers.csv" file which is included.

User progress is tracked through the prompts, any incorrect responses have the prompts reshuffled into the queue. At the end, the user is provided with a list of all prompts answered incorrectly.
